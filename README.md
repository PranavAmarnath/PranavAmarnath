**PranavAmarnath/PranavAmarnath** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different small projects under the "Secres" brand.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android (Mobile)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, AWT/Swing/JavaFX (Desktop), Vaadin Flow/Spring Boot (Web)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no idea when/where I came up with the "Secres" brand, but I've used it ever since. It is not an acronym.
