### Hi there ğŸ‘‹. You may be able to tell from my username; I'm Pranav Amarnath.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different small projects under the "Secres" brand.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android (Mobile)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, AWT/Swing/JavaFX (Desktop), Vaadin Flow (Web)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no idea when/where I came up with the "Secres" brand, but I've used it ever since. It is not an acronym.
